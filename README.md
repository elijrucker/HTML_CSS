# freeCodeCamp
A collection of projects created while obtaining various [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certifications. 
This is my first public repo and is very much an exercise in 'learning by doing'.

So far this repo contains:
  - HTML & CSS material as a part of my [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/elijrucker/responsive-web-design)

I'm currently working on:
  - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
I'll be uploading material as I progress.
