<section id="tribute-info">"A fire hydrant, fireplug, or firecock (archaic)[1] is a connection point by which firefighters can tap into a water supply. It is a component of active fire protection. Underground fire hydrants have been used in Europe and Asia since at least the 18th century. Above-ground pillar-type hydrants are a 19th-century invention."
